# English to French Seq2Seq Translation using TensorFlow

This project implements a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model using TensorFlow to translate English sentences to French sentences. Seq2seq models are widely used in machine translation tasks, and this project serves as an example of how to build and train such a model for language translation.

## Overview

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of a seq2seq model for translating English sentences to French sentences. Sequence-to-sequence models consist of an encoder and a decoder, where the encoder processes the input sequence (English sentence) and produces a context vector, which the decoder then uses to generate the output sequence (French sentence).
